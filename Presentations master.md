## Preparation
* Clear message
* Mind map
* 3-4 sections
* Do the main body first
* What is the timing ?
* 5 bullet points per slide
* 2-5 minutes per slide

## Start
* Start with a **question** to get people involved
* **Mysterious** start
* Get people motivated to listen: **what's in it** for the audience
* Run through the first 30 seconds to nail it

## Practicalities to cover

* Say who you are (give credibility and be modest). I've been doing this for years and I've done all the mistakes.
* Audience is the most important
* Mention the length of the talk
* Reassure that we are in the middle of the talk
* Vital to have an agenda (visual)
* Say: "Feel free to ask question during the presentation"
* Finish the introduction with a question

## Conclusion

* Never apologize
* Don't say: "so... any questions..."
* Say: "So there you have it"
*
