## Macro

not functions

they are **text substitution** in your code

LISP and FORTAN are the oldest codes

Careful with **cases**. Identifier are converted to lower case but strings are not converted.

Careful with **pair brackets**

**$** signes are converted to integer **literals**

option echomacro (This will show the substitution of the macro)

If you have mutlitple variable the substitution runs left to right and you might substitute *multiple times* things and erase variables

Naming convention (because everything is global): macroname.__varname
