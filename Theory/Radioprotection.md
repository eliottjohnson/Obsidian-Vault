Radioactive decay / Radioactivity: emittion of particles and radiation

Ionising radiation: radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms and molecules. They become charged

Radiactovity can't be smelled, felt, seen or heard

Units:
* Becquerel Bq: 1 Bq = 1 transformation (or decay) per second.
* Decay rate = Activity = number of decay per second
* Sievert Sv: effective dose of radiation on human health effect
	* 1.4 mSv annual medical exposure
	* 3 mSv annual aeroplane pilots
	* 4 mSv annual natural background
	* 20 mSv annual Max dose for a radiation worker
	* 146 mSv annual ISS
	* 10 Sv Lethal dose
* Dose rate = effective dose per time $\micro$Sv/h

Stray radiation stops when the accelerator is off
Residual radioactivity is still there when accelerator is off but decreases with time
