* LET is a function that provides the energy loss **per unit length**
* LET is strongly non-linear as a function of particle energy
* units:
	* $MeV cm^{2}/mg$
	* $MeV/mm$

* As the iron ion loses kinetic energy, it moves more slowly and has more time to generate more charge through more interactions with matter through which it is traversing.
* LET peaks at low energy also called **Bragg peak**
* Blue line is the range an ion travels in the material and thus the amount of material required to stop an ion at a particular kinetic energy.
	* i.e. with zero kinetic energy, an ion needs zero material to be stopped and does not an issue for device reliability
