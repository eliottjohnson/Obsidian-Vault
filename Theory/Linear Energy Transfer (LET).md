* LET is a function that provides the energy loss **per unit length**
* LET is strongly non-linear as a function of particle energy
* units:
	* $MeV cm^{2}/mg$
	* $MeV/mm$

* As the iron ion loses kinetic energy, it moves more slowly and has more time to generate more charge through more interactions with matter through which it is traversing.
* LET peaks at low energy
