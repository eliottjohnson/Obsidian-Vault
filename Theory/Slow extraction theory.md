## Spiral step
https://cds.cern.ch/record/2650734/files/CERN-THESIS-2018-278.pdf
Particles which are on one arm of the separatrix in one turn will be on the counter clockwise rotated arm in the next turn. Particles return to the same arm every three turns, but always a little further from the middle than earlier. If we track the phase space position of one unstable particle it seems like if it were “walking” outwards with increasing steps. The so-called spiral step is an important parameter of the slow extraction. Assume a particle which is just barely on the circulating side of the wires in one turn, then three turns later it is the extracted particle which is furthest away from the origin. The difference between the particle’s x coordinates in this turn and 3 turns later is called the spiral step. In other words, this is the length of the section on which particles are extracted or lost

## PS Tune control

The tune can be controlled with different quadrupolar elements such as:

* PFW (Pole-Face Windings)
* QSE (Quadrupole for slow extraction)
* LEQ (Low energy quadrupoles)
	* See [[Cern Control Center Tips and Tricks#Trim the tune function with LEQ]]

## Transit time

Transit time is the average time a particle takes to escape the triangle and get extracted. If you push all particles at the resonant tune then they will all start with different initial conditions. Some of them will take 100 turns to escape de triangle and some of them will take 1000 turns for example. Particles that are close to the fixed point will take a very long time to move to the separatrices.
