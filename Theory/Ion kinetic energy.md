# Ion kinetic energy

using Chao's formulas [[Accelerator Physics Theory]]

The rigidity is defined as
$$B\rho = \frac{pc}{q}$$
The total momentum for an ion beam is
$$pc={E_{0}\sqrt{\gamma^{2}-1}}$$
$$pc = E_{0}\sqrt{\left [ \left( \frac{E_{cin}}{E_{0}}+1\right )^{2}-1\right ]}$$
with $E_{0}$ the rest mass of the ion and $\gamma=\frac{E}{E_{0}}=\frac{E_{0}+E_{cin}}{E_{0}} = \frac{E_{cin}}{E_{0}}+1$

The kinetic energy for an ion beam is $E_{cin}=E_{cin\text{ per nucleon}}\cdot A$ where A is the atomic mass number (sum of number of protons and neutrons).

Example: if you want a lead ion beam Pb54+ (which means it has 54 charges) of isotope A=208 of energy 1 GeV per nucleon the momentum would be:

$$pc = E_{0}\sqrt{\left [ \left( \frac{2}\cdot 208}{E_{0}}+1\right )^{2}-1\right ]}$$
