Title: Beam delivery for CHIMERA transfer line

Abstract

* Stray fields
	* MFC model
* East Area
	* Low energy ions

## Transfer line optics

### Reconstruction of the initial parameters of the transfer line
* How it's sufficient to characterize the beam size (minimum in the same place)
* 

## Beam size

Specify what's the biggest beam size possible
Specifiy what's the smallest beam size pos

## Octupoles and homogeneous beam


Look in Norma database for old spare octupoles from the SPS and the ISE

Make the S-shape with PTC

biggest beam size
flatest beam
