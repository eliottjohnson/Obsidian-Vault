# Preparation
## Preparation
* Clear message
* Mind map
* 3-4 sections
* Do the main body first
* What is the timing ?
* 5 bullet points per slide
* 2-5 minutes per slide

## Start
* Start with a **question** to get people involved
* **Mysterious** start
* Get people motivated to listen: **what's in it** for the audience
* Run through the first 30 seconds to nail it

## Practicalities to cover

* Say who you are (give credibility and be modest). I've been doing this for years and I've done all the mistakes.
* Audience is the most important
* Mention the length of the talk
* Reassure that we are in the middle of the talk
* Vital to have an agenda (visual)
* Say: "Feel free to ask question during the presentation"
* Finish the introduction with a question

## Conclusion

* Never apologize
* Don't say: "so... any questions..."
* Say: "So there you have it"
* Summary or recap
* Finish with a call to action
* Finish with a quiz

## Know your audience

* Powerpoint (big audience or pictures)
* Hand out
* Flipchart (small audience)

# Overcoming Nerves - Practical Advice and Techniques

## Say it until it's true
* Self talk
	* Tell to yourself that you love giving talks
	* I'm the expert
	* It's going to be fine

## Make yourself bulletproof
* Back up plans for everything
* Have spare leads for presentation
* Bring own laptop
* Spare projector
* Bring spare notes (handouts)
* Bring spare marker pens

## Step off the stage
* Chat to the audience
	* They're just normal people
	* Adjust your talk subtlety
	* Friendly faces

## The Early Bird
* Get there really early

## It's better once you're up
* Stand up
	* More authority
	* Shows respect

## Ask the audience
* Ask the audience questions during your talk
	* Prepare your questions
	* What's my next point going to be
	* Pick on people
	* Just tell people to show of hands if they are shy
* They will enjoy it more

## Practise makes perfect
* Have a run through to check the timing
* Two run through at the most

# During the Presentation

## Looking the part
* Similar to audience but a bit smarter
* Nothing distracting
* Professional and boring
## How to plan the room
* Where are you going to stand ?
	* On the side of the screen
	* Don't block the door
* U-shape of tables
* Cabaret (cafe) style
* Classroom style
* Theatre style
* (Puts some chair away to fill up the first rank)

## Give them a sign
* You must have an agenda and have it visual
* Sign post the progress (a presentation is like going in a tunnel, let them know you're on schedule)
* Sign post that the ending is coming. "My final point is", "One more section and then we finished"

## Body language
* Be relaxed and be yourself
* Stand up
* Use the visual aid as an excuse to point things up
* Walk around a bit
* Try to smile
* Equal eye contact for everybody

## Audience interaction
* How to be interactive with the audience ?
* That's what great talks are like
* Prepare the question to ask the audience (allow time interaction)
* If you're getting answer from the audience, you know they're understanding.
* It gives you time to think
* They have to answer it in their head (even if they are not saying it out loud)
* Ask them a yes or no question
* Ask them examples
* Ask for an answer
* Put them into pairs
* Write answer on the flip chart
* Spotting a problem in a photo

## How to do a Talk without notes
* Never read from a script (no eye contact)
* Never learn a script of by heart
* An A4 page of notes which summarises your whole talk (in very brief bullet points) works really well
* Avoid cue cards - go for A4 instead so itâ€™s all on one page
* Write in pencil on your flip chart for a secret message to yourself
* Be cued by your visual aid - add any prices or dates or facts which you are struggling to remember.
	* Keep slides below about 20 words total if you can.
* No paragraph of text, only bullet point (4-5)

## Good and Bad Micro Sleeps
* Say everything important twice
	* In the intro, the main body and in the conclusion
* Hammer that point in
* Sum up every now and then so people can get back on the train (of your talk)

## Talks longer than 15 minutes
* Put activities
	* Discussion in pairs
	* Shout things out and add them to the flip chart
	* Post it note on the wall (for things that people are afraid of saying)
	* Get them to present something
