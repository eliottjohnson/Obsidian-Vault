* **Mysterious** start
* Get people motivated to listen: **what's in it** for the audience

## Practicalities to cover

* Reassure that we are in the middle of the talk
* Vital to have an agenda (visual)

# Overcoming Nerves - Practical Advice and Techniques

## Say it until it's true
* Self talk

## Make yourself bulletproof
* Back up plans for everything
* Have spare leads for presentation
* Bring own laptop
* Spare projector
* Bring spare notes (handouts)

	* Friendly faces

## The Early Bird

* They will enjoy it more

## Practise makes perfect
* Have a run through to check the timing
* Two run through at the most

# During the Presentation

## Looking the part
* Similar to audience but a bit smarter
* Nothing distracting
* Professional and boring
## How to plan the room
* Where are you going to stand ?
	* On the side of the screen
	* Don't block the door
* U-shape of tables
* Cabaret (cafe) style
* Classroom style
* Theatre style
* (Puts some chair away to fill up the first rank)

## Give them a sign
* You must have an agenda and have it visual
* Sign post the progress (a presentation is like going in a tunnel, let them know you're on schedule)
* Sign post that the ending is coming. "My final point is", "One more section and then we finished"

## Body language
* Be relaxed and be yourself
* Stand up
*
