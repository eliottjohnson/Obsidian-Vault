Three techniques are available to control the intensity of the spill during slow extraction to the East Area:
1) LEQ scaling
2) Scraping
	* When we scrape there is dispersion. We thus scrape the lower energy particle first
3) TFB
	* The transverse damper might help reduce the effect as we blow-up in betatronic amplitude and that should dominate over the dispersion part of the beam when scraping
