## [[YASP]]

- [x] Talk with Denis
- [x] Talk with Jurg
- [ ] upload custom twiss with different optics
- [ ] Add dipoles as correctors
- [ ] Add BTV as steerers
- [ ] Add the MWPC in the working set
- [x] Add device name as an additional field
- [x] Check if device name is correct
- [ ] Map device name to optics sequence name
- [ ] Add corrector strength to model and when you change optics, try to get back the same optics


## [[Picoscope]]

- [x] Discuss with Andreas and Natalia
- [ ] Picoscope test


## [[Multipole field component in MU62]]

- [x] Export MFC to seq and ele files
- [x] Add MFC to transfer line sequence
- [ ] Plot ellipse of stray field model
- [ ] Check Aperture restriction


## [[EDMS document East Dump]]

- [x] Use pessimistic situations (2 cycles dumped consecutively)
- [x] add margin to max. intensity
- [x] Look at comments
- [x] Check with Matt final list of reviewer
- [x] Start EDMS review procedure with Thomas Birtwistle
- [ ] Add Reference from Giulia for the Dump


## [[Emittance blow-up]]

- [ ] Calculate the new beta, beta1=bet0*pi/4
- [ ] The change in Beta is only if you want to rematch your beam to the scatterer.
- [ ] Maybe you could track distributions kick with a thin kick after the air, recalculate the distribution and continue tracking
- [ ] Meeting with Ruben, Andreas, Luigi and Matthew


## Other

- [ ] UDEMY: Python for Computer Vision
- [ ] Write in the codilog the marche Ã  suivre to perform a quadrupole scan and find init params
- [ ] Check BPM UCAP and logging if I get the same values
- [ ] Continue to write the CHIMERA document
- [ ] First moment, second moment
