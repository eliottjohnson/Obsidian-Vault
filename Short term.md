## CHIMERA

- [ ] Finish the CHIMERA doc
- [ ] Read the data from TIMBER of the ion run on the 28th of september including beam size on BTVs and MWPC
- [ ] Look at the BPM readout and MWPC readout at different energies
- [ ] Analysis quadrupole scan data at 750 and 500 MeV/u
- [ ] Save data from spill monitor and XSEC
- [x] Create a savedata script
- [ ] Picoscope test
- [x] Send Andreas BPM values from NXCALS for the parallel optics and follow up with his FLUKA simulation.
- [ ] Check Dispersion at BPM1


## [[ABTEF on CHIMERA Tuesday 25th from 16h to 17h]]

- [ ] Prepare presentation for ABTEF


## [[IPAC 2023]]

- [ ] Write an Abtract<br>* Stray fields<br>* East Area ion beams


## Stray Field

- [ ] Magnetic measurement of a spare MU being performed, create slides for Carlo to measure stray fields
- [ ] Continue with code ps_extraction/east-fast-extraction/stitched_slow_extraction_east_PTC_single_turn.ipynb
- [ ] Continue with code ps_extraction/east-fast-extraction/stitched_slow_extraction_east-PTC.ipynb
- [ ] Continue with code east-fast-extraction/ptc_track_in_ps.ipynb


## [[Multipole field component in MU62]]

- [ ] Connect PS Ring to Transfer line
- [ ] Track twiss from fast extraction and compare with measurement


## MWPC Timing issue

- [ ] Contact Stephen Jackson in charge of the BI-SW section


## [[Emittance blow-up]]

- [ ] Calculate the new beta, beta1=bet0*pi/4
- [ ] The change in Beta is only if you want to rematch your beam to the scatterer.
- [ ] Maybe you could track distributions kick with a thin kick after the air, recalculate the distribution and continue tracking
- [ ] Meeting with Ruben, Andreas, Luigi and Matthew
- [ ] Calculate a monte carlo dipole kicks (c.f. pycollimate)


## Other

- [ ] UDEMY: Python for Computer Vision
- [ ] Write in the codilog the marche Ã  suivre to perform a quadrupole scan and find init params
- [ ] Check BPM UCAP and logging if I get the same values
- [ ] First moment, second moment
- [ ] Fill out Topics for 2023 before next section meeting


## [[YASP]]

- [x] upload custom twiss with different optics
- [ ] Add the MWPC in the working set
- [ ] Add corrector strength to model and when you change optics, try to get back the same optics


## [[EDMS document East Dump]]

- [ ] Add Reference from Giulia for the Dump

- [x] Wednesday 28 MD with ions
- [x] Prepare the excel sheet I had to convert to ions
- [x] Quad scan for initial parameters with ions

- [x] - Beam size at three bending magnets: MBXHD005, MBXHD001 and MBXHD005
- [x] - MCB magnet aperture (quite large)
- [x] - Check Aperture restriction
- [x] Talk with Denis
- [x] Talk with Jurg
- [x] Add dipoles as correctors
- [x] Add BTV as steerers
- [x] Add device name as an additional field
- [x] Check if device name is correct
- [x] Map device name to optics sequence name

- [x] Check Aperture restriction
- [x] Use pessimistic situations (2 cycles dumped consecutively)
- [x] add margin to max. intensity
- [x] Look at comments
- [x] Check with Matt final list of reviewer
- [x] Optics on Slow ions 24 GeV (will be used on wednesday), then slow ions at 2 GeV
- [x] MAD-X use proton beam and then scale current by 54/82
- [x] Prepare a table with the old currents in the line when we had ions
- [x] Check LSA for how it computes the momentum and energy
- [x] How do you scale with energy ?
- [x] Look at the quad scan at low energy
- [x] Ask Jean-Michel how to log BLM-ST for MD3 and MD4 as well
- [x] Try to see the BTV acquisition from the dedicated MD
- [x] Do an FFT on the BLM008-ST samples by first converting the integral to a time series and then doing an FFT
- [x] Discuss with Andreas and Natalia
- [x] Start EDMS review procedure with Thomas Birtwistle
- [x] Plot ellipse of stray field model
- [x] Track single particles from Matt's distribution (non-linear can't do twiss)
- [x] Perform quadrupole scans at 750 and 400 MeV/u
