## Monday

- [ ] Continue understand rigidity for ions with the [[MU current scaling with momentum]] note and Andreas overleaf table
- [ ] Marc's code to ion energy to equivalent proton energy


## [[Picoscope]]

- [x] Discuss with Andreas and Natalia
- [ ] Picoscope test


## [[Multipole field component in MU62]]

- [x] Export MFC to seq and ele files
- [x] Add MFC to transfer line sequence
- [x] Plot ellipse of stray field model
- [x] Check Aperture restriction
- [ ] Connect PS Ring to Transfer line
- [ ] Track single particles from Matt's distribution (non-linear can't do twiss)
- [ ] Track twiss from fast extraction and compare with measurement


## CHIMERA

- [ ] Wednesday 28 MD with ions
- [ ] Prepare the excel sheet I had to convert to ions
- [ ] Quad scan for initial parameters with ions
- [ ] Look at the 2GeV/n beam and how the momentum scales in LSA, also the B-field. The rigidity will be lower because we gain charges


## [[EDMS document East Dump]]

- [x] Use pessimistic situations (2 cycles dumped consecutively)
- [x] add margin to max. intensity
- [x] Look at comments
- [x] Check with Matt final list of reviewer
- [x] Start EDMS review procedure with Thomas Birtwistle
- [ ] Add Reference from Giulia for the Dump


## [[Emittance blow-up]]

- [ ] Calculate the new beta, beta1=bet0*pi/4
- [ ] The change in Beta is only if you want to rematch your beam to the scatterer.
- [ ] Maybe you could track distributions kick with a thin kick after the air, recalculate the distribution and continue tracking
- [ ] Meeting with Ruben, Andreas, Luigi and Matthew
- [ ] Calculate a monte carlo dipole kicks (c.f. pycollimate)


## [[YASP]]

- [x] Talk with Denis
- [x] Talk with Jurg
- [ ] upload custom twiss with different optics
- [ ] Add dipoles as correctors
- [ ] Add BTV as steerers
- [ ] Add the MWPC in the working set
- [x] Add device name as an additional field
- [x] Check if device name is correct
- [ ] Map device name to optics sequence name
- [ ] Add corrector strength to model and when you change optics, try to get back the same optics


## Other

- [ ] UDEMY: Python for Computer Vision
- [ ] Write in the codilog the marche Ã  suivre to perform a quadrupole scan and find init params
- [ ] Check BPM UCAP and logging if I get the same values
- [ ] Continue to write the CHIMERA document
- [ ] First moment, second moment

## Archive

- [x] - Dipanwita would like to have beam size at the entrance and exit of F6x bends
- [x] - Beam size at three bending magnets: MBXHD005, MBXHD001 and MBXHD005
- [x] - MCB magnet aperture (quite large)
- [x] - Check Aperture restriction
