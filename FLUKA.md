Plot beam enveloppe, beam size along the line

Heatmap / contour plot 

Provide the aperture to Andreas

Plot rms dp/p
distribution of the enveloppe would go into the lower side, on the negative




plot loss due to inelastic scattering along the line
plot loss due to aperture along the line


No bunch rotation so we can do the tomoscope on wednesday
Chroma,
length of tune 
measure the momentum spread in the ring
.3 % for 24 GeV proton with bunch rotation
