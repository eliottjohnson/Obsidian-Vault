Following Yann’s suggestion, here is a quick email and some pictures about the electrostatic septum (ESE2) we built for CNAO, the medical laboratory in Italy.

Here is a link to their website : [https://fondazionecnao.it/en/.](https://fondazionecnao.it/en/)

An **electrostatic septum** is used to extract the beam from the accelerator towards the treatment area. This septum is 860mm long and is made of molybdenum foils (0.1mm thick). The cathode is made of titanium.

We designed this septum in 2020. We tried to reuse and mix all the good things we have in our electrostatic septa at CERN. For example, the foil tensioning system is the same as the SEH10 used in LEIR.

CNAO manufactured all the parts and we assembled them here at CERN during the summer. The only thing we made entirely at CERN is the high voltage feedthrough because CERN has the knowledge and in the industry it would have cost way too much money.

We placed all the displacement systems on one side of the tank because it’s more convenient in CNAO’s machine.

Externally, the cathode supports are placed on the septum displacement system, which means that the septum and the cathode move together inside the tank. And another displacement system moves only the cathode to adjust the gap. A third system is placed downstream to adjust the angle of the septum.

Inside the tank, the septum is placed on a table and this table is fixed on the displacement axis. A brass pivot allows the rotation of the table for the angular displacement.

This septum is driven by stepper motors. Unfortunately we didn’t have time to perform all the tests we wanted to because the septum must be in Italy before end of November. But the first tests went very well.

For the transport to Italy, we removed the cathode form the inside of the tank because the cathode is held by two ceramic rods and we didn’t want to risk them to break during the journey to Italy… We also removed the high voltage feedthrough because it also has fragile a ceramic tube. And in order to remove the cathode, we need first to remove the HV feedthrough. But what this means is mainly that we will need to go to Italy to assemble everything. We don’t know yet when they plan to install the new septum in their machine.

If you have any question or if you want to see more pictures, please don’t hesitate to ask. All the pictures are in DFS : [\\cern.ch\dfs\Departments\SY\Groups\ABT\Projects\CNAO\CNAO_ESE2\Photos](file://cern.ch/dfs/Departments/SY/Groups/ABT/Projects/CNAO/CNAO_ESE2/Photos)

If we had more time I would have organized a visit so you could all see the septum but as I said, we had to hurry up before end of November.
