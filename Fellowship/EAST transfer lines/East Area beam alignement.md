Problem: the beam moves vertically when we do optics changes

It can either be two things:
1) Quadrupole misalignment
2) Beam misalignment

The more a quadrupole is misaligned, the more the beam is bent

The more a misaligned quadrupole is pulsed, the more it bends the magnet

We find that the difference in beam position is 11 mm

The vertical corrector also explain this and it would mean that the IRRAD BPMs are misaligned by -5 mm to + 5mm
