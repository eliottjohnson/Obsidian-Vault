## Control

### Voltage increase

### Gas
Concerning the pressure, no, we can’t change the pressure. It’s always slightly higher than atmospheric.
However, we could try another scintillator gas. At the moment, we have N2 (100%), but I have a bottle of  Ar (96%) + N2 (4%) ready to be swapped, which should have a higher light yield. Changing the bottles would take less than 1 hour.
