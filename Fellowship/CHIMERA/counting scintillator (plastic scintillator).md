The plastic scintillator (also called XSCI) has for **objective**:
* Particle counting at low intensities in close proximity to DUT or directly upstream
* Identification of fragments

Characteristics:
* Plastic scintillator: PolyVinylToluene material (PVT), standard: 10x10 cm2 (can be larger?), variable thickness: 0.28mm (baseline) down to 100 um
* Radiation damage affecting the efficiency should not be a concern for two weeks of ion operation per year in the envisaged range of ion beam intensity
* The typical rise time is of the order of picoseconds, and the pulse duration of the order of tens of nanoseconds (similar to the diode).
