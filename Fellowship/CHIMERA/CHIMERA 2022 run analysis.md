# PS beam energy

## Some intro about how it is defined, including the lookup tables


See [[Pb ion lookup table]]

### How does the spill shape change with gain setting ?



# Beam spatial profile

## MWPC

-   Independence of beam profile with beam intensity, impact of energy on the beam shape, “explanation” of the dips (i.e. comparison with and without Montract), etc.

* make a plot of the MWPC beam size before and after my quadrupole scan to see if there is a change in beam size to confirm.
