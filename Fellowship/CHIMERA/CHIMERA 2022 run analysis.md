# PS beam energy

## Some intro about how it is defined, including the lookup tables


See [[Pb ion lookup table]]




## The nice colour showing which energy was used during each moment of the test

# Beam intensity

## RFKO and gain settings throughout the test

# Spill time profile

## Gas scintillator, SEC, XION, etc.

# Beam spatial profile

## MWPC

-   Independence of beam profile with beam intensity, impact of energy on the beam shape, “explanation” of the dips (i.e. comparison with and without Montract), etc.

* make a plot of the MWPC beam size before and after my quadrupole scan to see if there is a change in beam size to confirm.
