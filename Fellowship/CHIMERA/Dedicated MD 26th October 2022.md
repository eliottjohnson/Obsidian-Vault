## Ruben

* Would like to decide on what beam settings to use on 26/10.
	* Trade-off between lower energies and intensities
	* Doesn't want to be "at the limit" but rather keep some **margin** to have better visibility on the instruments


```ad-warning
**No protons on Wednesday** (such as a spare EAST in old super cycle)
```


## High priority

* Simulated **nominal slow extracted beam** we will use on the 23-28 November run
	* Low energy **750 MeV/u** (20 min)
	* Low intensity

* Several minutes with fixed beam settings
	* Perform characterization with **solid-state detector**
	* One beam configuration will be broken down with **degrader**
* Instruments:
	* SECs
	* XIONs
	* MWPC
	* Gas scintillator spill monitor
	* R2E
		* counting scintillator (plastic scintillator) - only use ions because protons would damage it
		* solid-state silicon detector
		* [[SRAM]]s

* **MWPC Quadrupole scan**, (30-60 min)
	* in IRRAD/CHARM
	* two last quads
	* find minimum
	* before degrader installation
	* high intensity
	* (would actually be best at 2 GeV/u to have less air scattering)

* **Intensity scan**, test three techniques (1 h):
	* LEQ strength and function shape
	* Bump23 strength
	* Bump23 + Feedback that shakes the beam
All the intensity would be at SE flat-top
Test spill length

## Access

* Access person from RP
	* Arnaud Devienne
	* Jean-Fran√ßois Gruber
* One access at 16:15
	* To install the degrader in the MONTRAC
* One access at 18:30
	* Remove the scintillator (IRRAD)
	* Remove the diode and SRAM (CHARM)

## Low priority
* Fast extraction and SEC calibration, see [[XSECs in East Area#Matthew]]

## Intensity degradation

* Bump technique on 23
* Marc wants to try on the 20.11.22 to degrade the intensity with a bump on [[TPS15 Dummy septum]] with bumpers 12-20 at the start of flat top
