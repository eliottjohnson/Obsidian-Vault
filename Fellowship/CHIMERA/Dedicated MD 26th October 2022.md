## Beam settings

* We will use during the whole MD the **750 MeV/u Pb ion beam**
	* Trade-off between lower energies and intensities
	* We won't be "at the limit" but rather keep some **margin** to have better visibility on the instruments

```ad-warning
**No protons on Wednesday** (such as a spare EAST in old super cycle) as this would break the plastic scintillator
```

## High priority

* Simulated **nominal slow extracted beam** we will use on the 23-28 November run
	* Low energy **750 MeV/u** (20 min)
	* Low intensity

* Several minutes with fixed beam settings
	* Perform characterization with **solid-state detector**
	* One beam configuration will be broken down with **degrader**
* Instruments:
	* SECs
	* XIONs
	* [[MWPC]]
	* Gas scintillator spill monitor
	* R2E
		* [[counting scintillator (plastic scintillator)]] - only use ions because protons would damage it
		* solid-state silicon detector
		* [[SRAM]]s

* **Intensity scan**, test three techniques :
	* LEQ strength and function shape
	* Bump23 strength
	* Bump23 + Feedback that shakes the beam
All the intensity would be at SE flat-top
Test spill length

## Schedule

```ad-important

Call Andreas and Natalia before and after beam modification to inform them when they can start logging data. They will separate the data logging into separate files.

```

**PS Shutdown from 08:00 to 12:00**
Access from 09:00 to 12:00

* Beam setup
	* Keep a note of the LEQ settings for afternoon degrader test
* High intensity data taking (~20 min)
* Low intensity setup (~ 20 min)
	* Keep a note of the LEQ settings + Bump23 height for afternoon degrader test
* Low intensity data taking (~20 min)

- **Degrader access installation at 16:15**

* High intensity data taking (~20 min)
* Low intensity data taking (~20 min)


## Access

IRRAD access is planned from 09:00 to 12:00. The cryostat needs an hour to move plus some additional time for the entry and exit of the zone. They'll stop the beam between 00:00 and 01:00 the night before.

Andreas and Natalia will install the plastic scintillator also during the 09:00 to 12:00 access and will require much less time

3h PS shutdown overlaps with the access

* Access person from RP
	* Arnaud Devienne
	* Jean-Fran√ßois Gruber
* One access at **16:15**
	* To install the degrader in the MONTRAC
* One access at **18:30**
	* Remove the scintillator (IRRAD)
	* Remove the diode and SRAM (CHARM)


## Low priority
* **[[MWPC Quadrupole scan#Low energy]]**, (30-60 min)
	* in IRRAD/CHARM
	* two last quads
		* k7 scan = -0.04, -0.1
		* k8 scan = 0.07, 0.08
	* find minimum
	* before degrader installation
	* high intensity
	* (would actually be best at 2 GeV/u to have less air scattering)

* Fast extraction and SEC calibration, see [[XSECs in East Area#Matthew]]

## Intensity degradation

See [[Intensity control for CHIMERA]]
* LEQ tune sweep adjustment
* Bump technique on 23
* TFB blow-up
* Marc tried on the 20.11.22 to degrade the intensity with a bump on [[TPS15 Dummy septum]] with bumpers 12-20 at the start of flat top


## Summary of the MD

No beam from 12-13 because of IRRAD access
No beam from 13-16 because of a faulty extraction kicker magnet from LEIR (great help from Nico Madysa)



We pushed the bump from 0.00321 (barely touching) to high around 0.00334 (completely kills the beam)

Then we used the TFB
Start - End BLU: 505 - 795
Exc DDS1harmonic 6.26000 (we scanned 6.25500 to 6.26500)
and the gain to 0.1200 works well

Some **jitter** during the blow-up:
* The jitter we saw might be due to the radial loop still being active when we make the bump in 23 to reduce the intensity.
* At low intensity the radial loop will be perturbed, also we also have a radial loop pick-up inside.
* Next time we need to do the intensity reduction **after** loop has been turned off
