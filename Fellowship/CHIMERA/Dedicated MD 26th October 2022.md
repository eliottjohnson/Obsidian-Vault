## Ruben

* Would like to decide on what beam settings to use on 26/10.
	* Trade-off between lower energies and intensities
	* Doesn't want to be "at the limit" but rather keep some **margin** to have better visibility on the instruments


## High priority

* Nominal slow extracted beam we will use on the 23-28 November run
	* Low energy
	* Low intensity
* Several minutes with fixed beam settings
	* Perform characterization with **solid-state detector**
	* One beam configuration will be broken down with **degrader**
* Instruments:
	* SECs
	* XIONs
	* MWPC
	* Gas scintillator spill monitor
	* R2E
		* counting scintillator
		* solid-state sillicon detector
		* SRAMs

### Low priority
* Fast extraction and SEC calibration, see [[XSECs in East Area#Matthew]]
