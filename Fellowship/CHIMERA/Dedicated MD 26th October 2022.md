## Ruben

* Would like to decide on what beam settings to use on 26/10.
	* Trade-off between lower energies and intensities
	* Doesn't want to be "at the limit" but rather keep some **margin** to have better visibility on the instruments


## High priority

* Simulated **nominal slow extracted beam** we will use on the 23-28 November run
	* Low energy **750 MeV/u**
	* Low intensity
* Several minutes with fixed beam settings
	* Perform characterization with **solid-state detector**
	* One beam configuration will be broken down with **degrader**
* Instruments:
	* SECs
	* XIONs
	* MWPC
	* Gas scintillator spill monitor
	* R2E
		* counting scintillator (plastic scintillator) - only use ions because protons would damage it
		* solid-state silicon detector
		* SRAMs

* **MWPC Quad scan**
	* in IRRAD/CHARM

## Medium priority



### Low priority
* Fast extraction and SEC calibration, see [[XSECs in East Area#Matthew]]
