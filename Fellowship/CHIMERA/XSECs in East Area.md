Continuation of the discussion on [[SEC calibration EAST]] and e-mail thread from Maarten Van Dijk from 17th October 2022

## Marteen
* There is a **activation foil measurement** that Maarten is doing in the North Area
* Fast mode of the XSEC (BSI) electronics does not work properly
	* We need to measure the charge collected on the XSEC (BSI) in the fast mode in a way that we can calibrate with the fBCT.
	* This calibration could be extrapolated to the calibration in the slow mode.

## Luana

* Main **issue**: fast extraction pulse is too fast to time the sampling to catch the extraction, the electronics don't have the bandwidth necessary
	* **Solution** would be to **link a scope** directly to the xsec in fast extraction
		1) Series of fast extraction to the F61 dump to measure signal from detector
		2) Miguel  Martin Nieto can assist with this (must be done before 3rd of November as he is away until 24th nov)
		3) Contact Romain Brice Ruffieux to ask if logged measurements are calibrated.

## Matthew

* Organise via ASM a parallel MD for 24 or 25th October
	* Send fast extracted proton and ion beams to East Dump
	* Measure fBCT and XSEC **connected to scope**
* Low priority: repeat comparison between fBCT in **T8** and dowstream XSEC also with **scope** (we'll need to move it)
*
