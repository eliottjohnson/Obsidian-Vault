# 750 and 400 MeV per nucleon

Ramp produit en croix avec le ratio du vieux et nouveaux momentum proton 

750 MeV/u c'est 5.392 GeV proton equivalent, see [[Current scaling for Ions]]

## Spill correction

We see two peaks and those can be corrected with LEQ

## Spill optimisation (intensity reduction and length increase) Tuesday 18.10.22

* [ ] try to reduce XSE strength
* [ ] try to do a local bump on TPS15
* [ ] try to reduce extracted intensity by changing QX_LEQ  (degraded extraction, tune kept a bit further from the resonance)


Reduced the intensity with the bump 23
