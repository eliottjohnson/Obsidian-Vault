- [ ] [[YASP]]<br>* [x] Talk with Denis<br>* [x] Talk with Jurg<br>* [ ] upload custom twiss with different optics<br>* [ ] Add dipoles as correctors<br>* [ ] Add BTV as steerers<br>* [ ] Add corrector strength to model and when you change optics, try to get back the same optics
- [ ] [[Multipole field component in MU62]]<br><br>* [ ] Plot ellipse of stray field model<br>* [ ] Check Aperture restriction
- [ ] * [ ] Write in the codilog the marche Ã  suivre to perform a quadrupole scan and find init params
