Title: Beam delivery for CHIMERA transfer line

Abstract

* Stray fields
	* MFC model
* East Area
	* Low energy ions


## Transfer line optics and beam delivery studies

### Reconstruction of the initial parameters of the transfer line
* How it's sufficient to characterize the beam size (minimum in the same place)
* 

## Beam size

Specify what's the biggest beam size possible
Specify what's the smallest beam size possible

**I'll need to do a MWPC scan for this**


## Homogeneous beam


### Octupoles
Look in Norma database for old spare octupoles from the SPS and the ISE

Make the S-shape with PTC

What's the flattest (most homogenous) beam that can be made

### Raster

Specify a raster technique

## Matthew will add a small chapter on the cycle development with Marc
