# Slow extraction spill duration

https://logbook.cern.ch/elogbook-server/GET/showEventInLogbook/3623801

The spill duration can be changed by modifying the QSE with the logical.PR.QSE/K

You want the tune of the bare machine to be quite close the resonance and then approach it using the QSE that increase the tune. There is however momentum spread which means that with [[Accelerator Physics Theory#Chromaticity]] the tune will already be resonant for some particles. 

For ions, it could also be possible to change the tune with the low energy quads and maybe even with the ramp on the B-field.
