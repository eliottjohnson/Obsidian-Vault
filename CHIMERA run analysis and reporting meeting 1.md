1) Technical note on flux adjustement

2) Technical note on solution implemented for the primary beam energy reduction:
	* PS B-field
	* Transport and scaling in T8

Send Andreas the data of the timestamp of the B-field
Check the 950 MeV if it ran
You could build LET as a function of energy

Can you compare LET of Pb with theory

New magic number from Kacper
