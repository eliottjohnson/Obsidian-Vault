# YASP

YASP is a script to steer the beam in the control room using numerical kick prediction.

It is useful when loading a new optics because it resteers the beam which is time consuming.

Ask Denis, Marcel and then Jurg


To-Do:
* [ ] Implement new corrector (dipoles)
* [ ] Add BTV, MWPC UCAP and BPMs devices as steerers
* [ ] Create a set of intermediate optics file not to loose the beam
