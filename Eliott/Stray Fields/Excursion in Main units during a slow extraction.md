Just a confirmation that you need to kick positive with both magnetic septums to be outside of the ring at MU62

What we can tell is that only MU62 and MU63 are in the stray fields.

We see that there is 2 order of magnitude more in the focusing part. Actually, instead of being focusing with G=5 it's defocusing with G=-5 T/m in MU62

Here we see clearly that in MU62, the focusing part is negative instead of being positive. This means we have to defocusing section one after the other. In MU63, the focusing part is close to zero as well but this should be compensated by the shims.

#### I made a mistake, I should have done four turns instead of three
Also now I'm tracking four particles at the edge of the phase space

It looks like my tune matching is wrong.

The plots below are made with a particles that is in the middle of the initial conditions.
