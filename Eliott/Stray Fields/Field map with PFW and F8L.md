# Field map with PFW and F8L

We want new field maps with the different loops (circuits) of the main units.

There are 1+5 loops:
* Main coil
* F8L
* Focusing wide
* Focusing narrow
* Defocusing wide
* Defocusing narrow

An example of current from Miro:
$I_{MC}=2667.5 A$
$I_{f8}=599 A$
$I_{fw}=57.47 A$
$I_{fn}=49.03 A$
$I_{dw}=-57.73 A$
$I_{dn}=-52.91 A$
