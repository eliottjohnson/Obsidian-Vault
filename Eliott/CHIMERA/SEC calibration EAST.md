# SEC calibration EAST

Kacper, Natalia, Andreas, Ruben.

December: Fast and Slow runs at different energies

SEC70 needs **firmware change** for fast extraction

**Goal**:
* calibrate SECs (mainly SEC71) with ions and protons as a function of fast extraction with the T8.fBCT.
* Have an absolute intensity measurement

**Test** (proposed by Matthew and F. Roncarolo):

Split signal from XSEC (in F61) and acquire raw signal on **picoscope**
* Send a parallel beam to the East dump
* Integrate picoscope signal and compare to adjacent fBCT to calibrate the signal
* Goal: absolute measurement of signal and slow extraction
* Varying intensities: 1e5 - 1e7 protons per spill

**Futur:
* Picoscope installed in IRRAD with UCAP at end of the year
*
