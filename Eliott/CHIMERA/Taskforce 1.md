# Taskforce 1

Present: Ruben, Kacper, Pablo, Natalia, Andreas, Andrea, Mario (online)
 
•	Ruben:	
	o	The targeted operation mode: DUT at the MONTRAC position, without CHARM target,
	o	RP requires ~12h of test with heavy-ions:
			Action: Arrange for a meeting with RP to discuss what conditions (e.g. target) they want to use,
			Beam size will be non-CHIMERA like, small beam on target as opposed to few x few cm,
	o	Foreseen schedule order: R2E (initial checks) -> RP (with target) -> R2E (qualify the beam before ESA) -> ESA -> R2E (use the leftovers),
	o	Foreseen energies: 5.GeV/u, 1GeV/u, maybe something below as long as we are able to extract the beam comfortably -> to be discussed at MD planning;
	o	Q1: Operation of the MONTRAC robot, can we take care of it? -> Action for Natalia: discuss with Jerome/Salvatore;
	o	Q2: Cooldown time after ion operation (mainly the facility, but also DUT), i.e. after switching off the beam what delay do we need to foresee? -> Action: ask RP for initial estimates?
	o	Q3: List of the trainings for both internal and external users? Action for Andrea;
	o	External users:
			Action for Ruben: arrange for a meeting with Salvatore/Jerome + main responsibles from the ESA/ESA-user side,
			•	Clarification of cabling & mech supports (@Natalia),
			•	Shipping to and from CERN – rules (@Andrea),
			•	RP declassification for the equipment (@Andrea),
	o	@Andrea: Check reports from NA and East tests in Run 2,
	o	@Andrea: preparation of 2 schedules (one internal, one more global to be shared), 
			maybe somehow using CERN’s ASM (https://asm.cern.ch/schedules/calendar?type=LHC&schedule=LHC%202022&version=1.1&state=Approved&view=year) tool? 

•	Kacper:
	o	B-I:
			Calibration to be performed at one of the MDs,
			•	How to modify the instrument gains? Action: to be checked with BI (Federico R),
			•	SLOW/FAST firmware change?  Action: to be checked with BI (Federico R),
	o	Can it affect the calibration? Action: to be checked with Federico Ravotti, based on his experience and analysis of the proton runs,
	o	Dashboard:
			Key parameters: Intensity (~flux), Beam spatial profile, Energy,
			•	Ideally some “calibration input from our side”,
			XIONs should not be neglected as we will go down with intensities,
			Conclusions: ~1min delay acceptable,
			Actions:
			•	Investigate how complex is to prepare such a dashboard?
			•	XSEC/BCT/XION calibration during one of the first MDs,

•	Natalia:
	o	Actions:
			Optimize number of accesses over the necessary cabling,
			Investigate the already present alignment mechanisms in CHARM,
