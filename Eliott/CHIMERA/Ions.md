## Lead Pb
![[Pasted image 20220919103331.png]]

Atomic number (Z), proton number ($n_{p}$) or charge number = 82

Pb 80+ means you almost fully stripped the lead atom from its electron (2 $e^{-}$ left)
Pb 80+ ions MD on Wednesday
Pb 54 for CHIMERA (28 $e^{-}$ left)

Stripping happens after the Q74L quadrupole

* Increasing the charge state reduces the rigidity of the beam:
