# MD Planning

### MD Objectives & beam requirements (part 1) – (SY-ABT | OP),
-   bringing back to life the 5.4 GeV/u cycle and setup a ~ 1 GeV/u ion cycle (Marc & Gil),
-   extraction using transverse damper excitation (low & stable beam intensities to EAST) (Matt, Pablo, Thomas):
	-   setting duplicate cycles with transverse damper option,
	-   testing this extraction mode for ion cycle(s),
-   characterization of the transfer line optics (Eliott):
	-   Quad scan & YASP (Yet Another Steering Program),
-   testing low energy (2GeV) proton transport to T8,
-   testing ions transport to T8 at different energies,

### MD Objectives  & requirements (part 2) – (R2E).
-   Focus on the needs related to beam instrumentation and logging:
	-   Testing if all BI logging is working correctly,
	-   Calibration of the SEC70 with T8.FBCT (ions, FAST),
		-   Different ion energies?

 ### Discussion:
-   Formal request procedure & timeline,
-   Actions distribution,
-   AoB




Ion cycle setup in PS on the dump (by Marc) at nominal energy.
Revived last years cycle to the east dump.

Two beams: one bunch version, other version nominal with two bunches (higher intensity) the second one is working.
What intensity do we want ?
* Lower intensity range, maybe easier to have a higher intensity beam and change extraction with different extraction techniques (transverse damper, need to steer extraction with bump height)
* 2e6 ions per spill last year.
* 1e10, 6e10 charges, so to lower we need to change extraction technique = play with the tune sweep (PFW)
* Look at spill with scintillator for spill as a function of time
* How low can we go with intensity with tune sweep ?


Optics measurements in parallel to dump (optics measurement) and to T8
T8 PPM ? Will be done with Kostas.
