# MD Planning

### MD Objectives & beam requirements (part 1) – (SY-ABT | OP),
-   bringing back to life the 5.4 GeV/u cycle and setup a ~ 1 GeV/u ion cycle (Marc & Gil),
-   extraction using transverse damper excitation (low & stable beam intensities to EAST) (Matt, Pablo, Thomas):
	-   setting duplicate cycles with transverse damper option,
	-   testing this extraction mode for ion cycle(s),
-   characterization of the transfer line optics (Eliott):
	-   Quad scan & YASP (Yet Another Steering Program),
-   testing low energy (2GeV) proton transport to T8,
-   testing ions transport to T8 at different energies,

### MD Objectives  & requirements (part 2) – (R2E).
-   Focus on the needs related to beam instrumentation and logging:
	-   Testing if all BI logging is working correctly,
	-   Calibration of the SEC70 with T8.FBCT (ions, FAST),
		-   Different ion energies?

 ### Discussion:
-   Formal request procedure & timeline,
-   Actions distribution,
-   AoB
