## Lead Pb
![[Pasted image 20220919103331.png]]

Atomic number (Z), proton number ($n_{p}$) or charge number = 82

Pb 80+ means you almost fully stripped the lead atom from its electron (2 $e^{-}$ left)
Pb 80+ ions MD on Wednesday
Pb 54 for CHIMERA (28 $e^{-}$ left)

Stripping happens after the Q74L quadrupole

* Increasing the charge state **reduces** the rigidity of the beam (it is less rigid as there are more charge and more easily bent):
* Rigidity $=B\rho$ in $\text{[Tm]}$
* $B\rho=\frac{P}{|q|} = \frac{PC}{|CHARGE*c*1e-9|}$

* Highly charged ions will be bent to the inside of the machine
$$\frac{(B\rho)_1}{(B\rho)_0} = \frac{\Delta(B\rho) + (B\rho)_0}{(B\rho)_0} = \frac{p_1}{p_0}\frac{q_0}{q_1}=\frac{q_0}{q_1}=\frac{54}{82}$$ where $p_1=p_0$ across the foils
