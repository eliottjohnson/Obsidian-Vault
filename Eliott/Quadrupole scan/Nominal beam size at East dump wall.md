# Nominal beam size at east dump wall

Here's the beam size I expect at the East dump wall. I show on the left plot the measurement I took with the non-saturated filter wheel as well as the MAD-X simulation with the new initial parameters. These are the same quadrupoles strength as the operational beam uses since end of April 2022.
