# Find the centre of the Q74 quadrupole

* Scan Q74 strength and measure beam movement on BTV012 or BTV dump

* Follow up with bumper transfer function

So if the beam is off center in the first Q74, it will be steered left or right.

If you scan current/quad strength and the Q74 is misaligned (or beam misaligned) you'll also have a steering

The next graph tells us as we scan the Q74 current how much the beam center moves with respect to the Q74/beam misalignment.
This means we can know if we are in the center of the Q74.

However, if the beam is centered in the Q74 and you scan for current, the beam centroid won't move

However, an error on the Q74 position doesn't change the beam size (all the points line up) ?
