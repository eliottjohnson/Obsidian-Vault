# Super-cycle length

Mail from Marc Delrieux on 16.08.2022

**Basic Period (BP)** is the minimum cycling period of the CERN complex.
* It is always 1.2 s.
* Every PSB cycles are 1 BP.
* PS cycles are multiples of 1 BP
* EAST cycle is 2 BP (2.4 s) because of the time necessary to ramp up to flat top at 24 GeV/c and do the slow extraction
* EAST dump is 2 BP

**Super-cycle (SC)**
* Determined by the SPS
* Usually the shortest SC is 24 BP
* LHC filling SC of 12 BP
* Longest is 34-35 BP but can be even more
* In practice: 2 cycles EAST for every 10 BP for users
* Consecutive to EAST should be avoided as the SMH57 might heat up too much

Use case would be to have 1 or 2 60E+10 protons per SC for a SC of 24 BP
