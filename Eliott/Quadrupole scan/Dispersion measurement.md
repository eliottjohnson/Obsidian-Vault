# Radial steering for dispersion measurement
Delta momentum before extraction and after extraction and change by a few % not to disturb the extraction

I think the parameter to change is PA.FREV-SD
Can you still do a dispersion measurement if the beam isn't centered in the quadrupole being scanned ?

$D=\frac{\Delta x}{\frac{\Delta p}{p}}$

We want to change the revolution frequency $\frac{\Delta f}{f}= -\eta\frac{\Delta p}{p} = -(\frac{1}{\gamma^{2}_{tr}} - \frac{1}{\gamma^{2}})\frac{\Delta p}{p}$

$\eta$ can be found in MAD-X by running a twiss

Marche Ã  suivre in Accelerator Physics by S.Y. Lee p.137:
$$ D = \frac{\Delta x}{\frac{\Delta p}{p}}$$

and $$ \frac{\Delta p}{p} = -\frac{\Delta f}{\eta f} $$

$$ D = \frac{\Delta x}{-\frac{\Delta f}{\eta f}} = -\eta f_{0} \frac{\Delta x_{co}}{\Delta f_{0}}$$ this assume linearily because I replaced $\delta$ by $\Delta$

Where $x_{co}$ is the closed orbit, $f_{0}$ is the revolution frequency, $\eta$ is the phase-slip factor. The momentum of the beam is varied by changing the rf frequency.

Basically, the Dispersion at a certain location is the slope of the change of position $\Delta x$ as a function of the change in frequency $\Delta f$. So if I do a fit of position as a function of frequency at each BTVs multiplied by $-\eta f_{0}$ I can get the Dispersion function at that location ($D(x_{BPM}$).

Then to check I can compare the Dispersion in MAD-X with my measurements like in the second plot.

WorkingSet -> LONGITUDINAL -> CPS:LL_H8H16 -> PAS.GSRPOS to change the frequency. This is an array so maybe grab java object and then change it.

PA.FREV-SED to monitor the frequency change
Also you can look at the sampler: Sampler -> BCT + ... @ CO -> PA.FREV-SD

Pay attention that the first sample acquires at 150 ms
