# Damper extraction

Sweep during extraction (see. [[BTV filters#Time dependant optics and sweep]]) might be solved using a different slow extraction technique by keeping the PS static and using a single variable (i.e. the damper) to skim the outer layer of the beam and extract very slowy.

repetition rate of 1ms of the chirp hide the spikes in the spill
Chirp: sweep frequency between two tones
Amplitude can be modulated but only between different chirp - you can have different chirp in a single cycle


Two different chirps at two different amplitudes would be nice. 
Quadrupolar noise. One chirp H, one V and third chirp is combined.
