Radioactive decay / Radioactivity: emittion of particles and radiation

Ionising radiation: radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms and molecules. They become charged

Radiactovity can't be smelled, felt, seen or heard

Units:
* Becquerel Bq: 1 Bq = 1 transformation (or decay) per second.
* Decay rate = Activity = number of decay per second
* Sievert Sv: effective dose of radiation on human health effect
	* 1.4 mSv annual medical exposure
	* 3 mSv annual aeroplane pilots
	* 4 mSv annual natural background
	* 20 mSv Max dose for a radiation worker
	* 24
